<li>
<p>
In the relationship between acceptme and the User, electronic documents certified by a basic
e-signature can be used.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A basic e-signature is an electronic signature that, through the use of the User’s login and
password or the e-mail address of the User indicated in the Personal Account (electronic
signature key), confirms the fact that the electronic signature is generated directly by the
User.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
As agreed by the Parties electronic documents signed by a basic e-signature shall be
recognized as equivalent to documents on paper signed with a wet signature.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
acceptme identifies the User, to whom a basic e-signature corresponds, according to the
User’s login and password stipulated during registration/authorization in the Platform - in
case of any actions on use of the Platform or according to the email address applied by the
User - in case of acceptme received any messages from this address.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Any actions taken using a basic e-signature of a certain User shall be deemed committed by
such User.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The User shall be obliged to keep confidentiality of the electronic signature key. In
particular, the User is not entitled to transfer his/her login and password or provide
access to his/her e-mail to third parties, and the User shall be fully liable for their
safety and personal use, independently choosing the way they are stored and limiting access
to them.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In case of unauthorized access to the login and password, their loss or disclosure to third
parties, the User is obliged to immediately notify acceptme about this by sending an e-mail
from the e-mail address stipulated in his/her Personal Account.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In case of loss or unauthorized access to the e-mail address stipulated in the Personal
Account, the User shall be obliged to immediately change such address in the Personal
Account with a new one and report this fact to acceptme by sending an e-mail from a new
e-mail address.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h2>Final Provisions</h2>
<ol class="ol-1-1">
<li>
<p>
If by any reason one or several provisions hereof become invalid or unenforceable, this does
not affect the validity or applicability of the remaining provisions hereof.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
acceptme’s inaction in case of violation by the User of the provisions hereof does not
deprive acceptme of the right to take appropriate actions in defense of its interests later,
nor does it mean that acceptme waived its rights in case of subsequent same or similar
violations.
