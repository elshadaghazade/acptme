										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opening a medical center is not an easy thing, but it is much more difficult to develop it correctly. Today, competition in this area has reached unprecedented heights. Everyone is trying to offer the best services at an affordable price. How to develop a medical center in such harsh conditions? What to pay attention to? This article will answer these important questions. Let’s consider the medical practice development in terms of promotion and attracting new customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is hardly possible to come up with something fundamentally new if you have a private clinic. The list of services and doctors remains unchanged from competitor to competitor, occasionally supplemented by new treatment methods and new specialists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, to ensure the systematic development of a private clinic, you need to think about how to properly and effectively use what you already have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some ways to attract visitors and increase the profitability of your medical business:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Invest in an online presence</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carefully think of your development strategy on social networks. This will help strengthen your online presence. Remember that more than 50% of all users today first search for information about services on the network, make their choice and only then come to the website. To generate more clients on the Internet, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Create a website if you do not already have one. You don’t need to hire a developer to do it. Simply use such services as <a href="https://tilda.cc/" rel="nofollow">Tilda</a>, <a href="https://wix.com/" rel="nofollow">WIX</a> or <a href="https://wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">WordPress</a>. Also, create pages in popular social networks</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where you possibly can find new customers: Facebook and Instagram. If the website has already been created, do not forget to optimize it: make a logical structure, add navigation, fill with high-quality content and speed it up.</span></p>
<p><strong>Don’t forget about SEO promotion for your website.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> To get started, create a SEO concept by selecting keywords relevant to your topic. Remember that keywords must be collected separately for each page! After that, add them to the finished website texts or create new content for the site &#8211; for instance, an article or any text for one landing page. This is necessary if you want your customers to easily find you in search engines. Collecting keywords and using them properly is not an easy task so you can hire a specialized agency to do it for you.</span></p>
<p><strong>Set up contextual advertising.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Create some powerful ads that will appear among the first three in the search engine when your potential customer searches for some medical services. Use </span><a href="https://skillshop.exceedlms.com/student/catalog/list?category_ids=53-google-ads?use_local=true" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Skillshop for Ads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to learn how to create ads. The most common search is “clinics near me” or “ *particular medical service* near me”. Do not forget to prepare the page in advance for the visitors: it should look perfect and convincing, otherwise, you can lose the interest of your potential clients.</span></p>
<p><strong>Engage in social media promotion.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Regularly fill your social pages with informative content. Publish more photos of real visitors, talk about the competence of your doctors, post the current schedule and promotions. Don’t forget about targeted advertising: this is a relatively inexpensive way to attract customers. The main thing is to choose the right audience to target to.</span></p>
<p><strong>Work with negatives and respond to positive reviews.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Not all the clients write reviews about their experience with your clinic only on your website or in specially designated places. They share their notes everywhere on the Internet! Your task is to find all possible references to your clinic, thank them for their kind words, and deal with cases that caused a negative. Reputation management is very important when it comes to retain clients and attract new ones.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Attract customers offline</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development of the medical practice center includes not only online activities. Good old offline methods also work:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advertise on local radio or tv-channels;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hand out flyers;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communicate at thematic conferences;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to get into the local media more often (but only on good occasions).</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Optimize medical practice management efficiently</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the above methods of the medical business development are aimed at attracting customers because they make up the basement of any ongoing business. However, there is another, more complex way to develop your clinic. It is based on the optimization of processes occurring within the company. This approach helps to increase work efficiency, reduce costs, and put the released funds into business development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, consider the following solutions to solve every medical practice management problems:</span></p>
<p><strong>A revision of the <a href="https://www.yclients.com/en/electronic-schedule">doctors’ schedule</a>.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Many specialists, especially narrowly targeted ones, do not need to constantly be in the clinic. They can come only on call, and you do not have to pay for their working hours.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_4036" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4036" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-4036" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Group-26-1-1024x702.jpg" alt="appointment scheduling calendar" width="800" height="548" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Group-26-1-1024x702.jpg 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Group-26-1-300x206.jpg 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Group-26-1-768x527.jpg 768w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Group-26-1-130x90.jpg 130w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Group-26-1.jpg 1218w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4036" class="wp-caption-text">Use Appointment Schedule Tool to manage your entire clinic</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Competent <a href="https://www.yclients.com/en/finances-and-accounting">financial and accounting management</a>.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you do not understand where the money goes, developing a business can be tricky. Better to exclude human mistakes and delegate this task to medical practice software.</span></p>
<p><strong>Maintaining a customer base.</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Attracting a new customer is much more difficult than returning an old one. </span><a href="https://www.yclients.com/en/client-base"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collect a patient base</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and remember your patients. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communicate with them with SMS, email or in messengers efficiently. You can group clients, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for instance,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by their last visit date and the medical treatment they got, and send them special offers to get them back.</span></p>
<p><strong>Optimization of the booking process for your customers.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You can reduce the cost of maintaining the army of administrating managers and receptionists by simply installing the </span><a href="https://www.yclients.com/en/online-booking"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online booking widget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on your website or in socials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can simplify all this complex work on developing a medical practice center by optimizing processes using the YCLIENTS program  – an online booking software and all-in-one automation platform for service-based businesses.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current situation affected middle and small businesses all over the world. We are all in this together and still fighting for each other. But it doesn’t mean the virus impact on business is only negative! Yes, we can’t deny the financial problems everyone is facing now, but the crisis always makes you think of new ways to earn more or the ways to optimize your business when it is all over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things are definitely going to change. Soon your clients start coming back (yes they will!), it could be hard to manage your business with only pen and paper — it will only make it harder to grow your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, when everyone else is taking compelled break — be smarter and take your time to think of how you can increase your revenue after the crisis. You have the power to change, evolve and adapt to the current innovative times. See these times as an opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The traditional method of taking appointments typically looks like that: the client calling to book a service, waiting till someone there picks up the phone and only then your staff schedule this appointment. Quite time-consuming and sometimes really inconvenient, hah? How to step further and get those tech-savvy potential clients and also optimize all your routine to be more efficient and have more time for more important tasks after the quarantine when it is needed the most?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Need a solution? Pick any from the list!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>1. Let people book you online</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it was said before, time is changing – digital spreads wider to all types of businesses and the current crisis proved it. Buying and ordering services via a smartphone is a common thing. The possibility of <a href="https://www.yclients.com/en">online booking</a> is a great opportunity to demonstrate to your clients that you keep up with the time and to allow them to book your services wherever they are. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get new appointments 24/7 on your website, in messengers, socials or your branded app.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-4066 size-full" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dizajn-bez-nazvaniya-3.png" alt="online booking app" width="560" height="315" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dizajn-bez-nazvaniya-3.png 560w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dizajn-bez-nazvaniya-3-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schedule Calendar makes things even easier to control at ease: schedule, update and assign appointments to your employees in a few clicks. Your staff members will always have access to their schedules.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-4064 size-full" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dizajn-bez-nazvaniya-2.png" alt="appointment schedule calendar" width="560" height="315" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dizajn-bez-nazvaniya-2.png 560w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dizajn-bez-nazvaniya-2-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These measures lead to higher staff productivity – you and your team can spend less time on cumbersome tasks, and get higher-level jobs done much more efficiently excluding human errors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>2. Convert your customers into the loyal ones</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the lockdown times, only the strongest businesses will remain working and there will be even higher competition for the clients who, unfortunately, lost their previous place to get the services they need. Don’t cut your marketing costs as it is what helps your business running.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is time to be especially customer-oriented and find a solution that can easily store your customer preferences and personal notes, so you can track their service history and stay updated with their habits, likes, and dislikes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the collected information &#8211; group your clients and create a special communication strategy with them via email or SMS. Send them special offers or wish a happy birthday. Be nice!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>3. Reduce the number of no-shows or late arrivals and save your money</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our research at <a href="https://www.yclients.com/en">YCLIENTS</a> found that sending an appointment reminder reduced late arrivals by 60%. For this reason, it’s essential that you confirm, remind, and follow-up with customers who have booked a service.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-4065 size-full" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/push.png" alt="appointment reminder" width="734" height="264" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/push.png 734w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/push-300x108.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 734px) 100vw, 734px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t forget about the email communication! Let your clients know you are still there for them &#8211; send newsletters or just update them on how things are going.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When your business is open for visitors again, feel free to use this template to let your clients know they are welcome again:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Subject line:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Yay! We are here for you again!</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><em>Email body:</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi </span><strong>&lt;Name&gt; </strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just here to let you know that </span><strong>&lt;business name&gt;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is finally open. Despite the fact of these difficult times for all of us, we understand that there might be a need for what we do. If you’re up to, we’re here to serve you.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hygiene is an essential part of our work, but we have strengthened measures to comply with disinfection rules that prevent the spread of the pandemic. </span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re following these instructions to stay on the safe side: </span></em></p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frequent hand-washing;</span></em></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lots of tissues and sanitizers for your usage;</span></em></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gloves and face masks on during service;</span></em></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disinfecting tools and seats after each visitor.</span></em></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have traveled abroad or experiencing health issues, we still advise you to stay home and reschedule your appointment &#8211; we will be waiting for you. </span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking forward to have you again &#8211; feel free to book us online: </span><strong>&lt;Link&gt;</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your </span><strong>&lt;Business name&gt;</strong></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opening a beauty salon is only half the battle. Competent management is no less important here. As a beauty salon owner, you should pay attention to every detail and not let anything drift. Otherwise, you may encounter unsatisfied customers, poor quality service, inspections by supervisory authorities and profit loss.</span></p>
<h3><b>Beauty salon management involves monitoring:</b></h3>
<p><strong>Ongoing expenses and revenue.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It is necessary to fix these indicators and double-check all documents daily. Pay particular attention to excessing income (more than 30%) or expenses (more than 20%).</span></p>
<p><strong>Primary expense documentation.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Financial management of a beauty salon is best left to the accountant or the director himself. If you constantly monitor all the indicators, you can timely identify inappropriate spending, theft and much more.</span></p>
<p><strong>The individual dynamics of masters’ performance.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It allows you to identify the most productive employees and those who are least interested in professional development.</span></p>
<h3><b>Build an effective beauty management system</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The profitability of a beauty salon depends largely on the position of the business owner. To achieve your business goals, you cannot do without an interesting concept and a detailed plan for implementing the strategy. If there is no clear control system, then the owner of a beauty salon runs the risk of facing following problems:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a lack of interest of employees in the business development of the salon.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">non-observance of discipline and company charter.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">incorrect management actions that interfere with business development, or lack thereof.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Try effective ways to get more clients</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to successful sales in the beauty business is the availability of regular customers. Effective beauty salon management implies the organization of a customer-oriented service. In this case, it refers to the creation of a marketing plan, a loyalty program, special offers, etc. Marketing in the beauty industry is one of the most powerful ways to attract new clients and retain old ones.</span></p>
<h3><b>How to manage a beauty salon without experience?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the following tips:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Do a little more for your customers than what they expect.</strong> Attentive and friendly attitude to visitors will help to build trust between your brand and your customers. In case of some minor misunderstandings, those clients will always be a little bit more loyal and will less likely spread negative reviews.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Better not impose additional services to the real or potential client.</strong> This can cause a negative reaction. Optimally, if you or your employees take an interest in what else you could help him or her and suggest accordingly their real needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tell only the truth about the services offered.</strong> If you embellish the result and the client receives not what is expected, the reputation of your salon will be tarnished, and the visitor is unlikely to return again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Do not forget to pamper your regular customers.</strong> Make a discount or provide some service as a gift. This approach will be the key to the client’s heart, he or she will remember this and come back to your salon once again.</span></p>
<h3><b>How to get more appointments right at the beginning?</b></h3>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dentistry is one of the most favorable areas for investments, but with high competition. In every city, there are dozens of dental centers: from modest dental offices to large network clinics. To stay afloat, it is necessary to know how to attract patients to the dental clinic efficiently.</span></p>
<h3><b>Here are 6 effective points to consider when attracting dental patients:</b></h3>
<h4><b>Location</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be a winner, it is not necessary to have an office in the city center. It is important that the hospital is conveniently accessible by public and private transport.</span></p>
<h4><b>The personnel competence</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professionalism, accuracy, and cleanliness of a personnel are visible from the first minute of the meeting. If a doctor started a patient examination without gloves, and during treatment caused discomfort, the client is unlikely to make an appointment again. You can also attract patients by treating complex diseases, conducting rare operations, using experimental but reliable techniques.</span></p>
<h4><b>Offline and online advertising</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to attract patients to the dentistry that has just opened? At first, only online and street advertisement will work. Use any tools: flyers, banners, billboards, websites, social networks. Later, patients will hopefully come via word of mouth.</span></p>
<h4><b>Marketing campaigns</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discounts, promotions, and special offers have always been an effective way to attract patients to dentistry. Reduced prices will help expand the audience among students and retirees. Try to go viral with exceptional quality of service or interesting marketing offers &#8211; for instance, first free visit for new clients or 20% discount if a patient refers to anyone else.</span></p>
<h4><b>Feedback</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the provision of the service, doctors should ask clients if they are satisfied with everything. You can ask to leave feedback on the website or on the company&#8217;s page in social networks. Or encourage them to do it with special offers for their next visits.</span></p>
<h4><b>Automated service</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making an appointment with a doctor through the registry is becoming less and less relevant &#8211; your clients use computers or telephones to make it very convenient and time-saving. </span><a href="https://partners.yclients.com/en" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online booking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an efficient way to get an appointment in a few clicks. Busy people do not need to leave work to come to the hospital and make an appointment with a doctor, and introverts do not have to call &#8211; let them book your services online.</span></p>
<h3><b>Attracting corporate clients in dentistry</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corporate clients for dentistry are a gold mine for a business. One company can bring an average of 10-15 clients to the clinic. There are two ways to increase client flow to dentistry by proposing:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">corporate subscription for employees;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signing a service contract at a discount.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In both cases, the dental clinic receives a significant influx of customers, and the head of the company demonstrates care for its employees. You can contact the owners of companies by phone or e-mail, sending a commercial offer.</span></p>
<h3><b>Automate your dentistry business</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the ways to attract clients to dentistry allows you to keep them and convert them into regular visitors. However, to make your clinic even more modern and convenient for patients, it is advisable to automate the basic processes of your everyday routine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This can be done by the cloud platform </span><a href="https://partners.yclients.com/en" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YCLIENTS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is attached to the website and allows you to solve numerous problems for both visitors and clinic staff.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_4036" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4036" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-4036 size-large" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Group-26-1-1024x702.jpg" alt="appointment scheduling calendar" width="800" height="548" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Group-26-1-1024x702.jpg 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Group-26-1-300x206.jpg 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Group-26-1-768x527.jpg 768w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Group-26-1-130x90.jpg 130w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Group-26-1.jpg 1218w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4036" class="wp-caption-text">Use Appointment Schedule Tool to manage your entire clinic</figcaption></figure>
<p><b>Online booking.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Patients can get to the dentist with a few clicks. They only need to choose a doctor, date and convenient time, and then fill their phone number and email in.</span></p>
<p><b>Appointment calendar.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It’s enough for a doctor to have a phone on hand to find out his schedule. YCLIENTS automatically records all client data, which are then displayed by the clinic staff in their appointment calendar.</span></p>
<p><b>SMS and email alerts</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Set up automatic sending of notifications to the customer’s email or phone a couple of days before receiving it. So the patient will definitely not miss a trip to the doctor, and you will not have windows in the schedule.</span></p>
<p><b>Customer database.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This function allows you to increase the customer focus of your dental clinic. You can easily track the frequency of visits. For regular customers this way you can develop personalized discounts and increase their loyalty. For those who are new, organize a newsletter with all your clinic updates and important information or offers.</span></p>
<p><strong>YCLIENTS will ensure the guaranteed involvement of primary patients in dentistry and turn them into regular customers of your clinic!</strong></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business in sports and health is a promising new business option. But before you open a fitness studio from scratch, it is important to calculate the cost of future investments, draw up a business plan, determine a management and promotion strategy so that the invested funds pay off as quickly as possible. Be sure to analyze your competitors and potential clients. Try to find your competitive advantage and find a way to minimize your costs. So you will understand whether it is profitable to open a fitness club and worth doing in your area.</span></p>
<h3><b>Consider the legal stuff</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you open a fitness club, you do need to be aware of all the legal issues on your local regulations. Usually, a certain set of documents is needed:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">registration documents of the legal form of business (for instance, LLC);</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">lease/ purchase agreement for sport equipment;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">permission of fire and sanitary inspections;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">conform to the standards set by a local health organization (for instance, in the UK it is Health and Safety Executive (HSE)).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the country you are opening your fitness business in, there are also certain insurance requirements like Professional indemnity insurance for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fitness instructors </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and so. </span></p>
<h3><b>Calculate the main costs</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not borrow money and do not spend personal savings until you have precisely calculated how much it costs to open a fitness club from scratch in your case. Costs are directly dependent on the scope and concept of the project. But for any fitness room, the main expense items are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">rental/purchase agreement;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">leasing/purchase of fitness and sport equipment;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">staff salary;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">tax deductions;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">installation of fire safety systems, ventilation, air conditioning;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">utility payments;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">phone and Internet costs.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Find your target audience</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of opening your fitness room from scratch largely depends on your clients’ ability to pay. Keep this in mind and establish pricing policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can count on a narrow segment, for example, open children&#8217;s fitness, or combine classes for different groups. This directly affects the choice of equipment. For example, to open a fitness studio for women, you are unlikely to need powerful fitness equipment for bodybuilders. But it’s probably worth buying treadmills, exercise bikes, stretching equipment, low and medium power loads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is highly advisable to decide in advance whether it is worth opening a fitness room for group training for aerobics, gymnastics, yoga, etc. This decision affects the layout and the required amount of free space. On average, in group classes, there are 2 square meters per client and 3 square meters per coach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that the new fitness business has more potential for success with the exclusive training type, in which there are almost no competitors. This can be a trampoline center, gymnastics in hammocks, EMS-training, etc. Although with the right business approach, a classic fitness studio can succeed.</span></p>
<h3><b>Choose fitness studio </b><b>premises</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you open a fitness studio from scratch, it is important to choose the right location. If you have a small hall planned (up to 150 square meters) and you are counting on a small audience, it is better to open a club in a calm neighborhood so that people can visit it in their free time. It can consist of one training room, a locker room, and a bathroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is reasonable to open a large fitness club with an extensive list of services for different groups of visitors in the city center or in the large shopping centers so that it is convenient to get to it from different parts of the district.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most fitness centers are designed for up to 60 people in an area of ​​about 400 square meters. They accommodate:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">reception desk;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">locker rooms;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bathroom;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">training room and a room for group classes.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Real calculation of income and expenses</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you open a fitness studio, multiply the cost of all possible costs by two, and reduce the probable income by 2 times for six months in advance. Why do this? Because absolutely all risks and problems cannot be predicted. By calculating the increased costs and reduced income, you can improve the model of your new business in the first stages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To avoid potential risks, many people decide to work on a franchise. Usually, it is less costly and, as a huge plus, you have a well-established brand. Anyway, this approach has its pros and cons.</span></p>
<h3><b>What do you need to know to open a franchise fitness studio?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, when you think about how to open a fitness club: from scratch or under a franchise, you choose between taking risks and a viable, well-considered business model. In these cases, guarantees for profitability are different.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With your own business from scratch, fitness clubs do not receive a large flow of visitors in the first six months. About 85% of them quickly close due to a lack of experience and incorrect calculations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In cooperation with the franchisor, you are only looking for a room and draw up permits. Other issues are dealt with by the franchise developer. Then the probability of a successful startup is much more. But if you want to calculate as accurately as possible how much it costs to open a fitness room for a franchise, you should consider not only the initial payment but also monthly percentage-based payroll. These deductions are made as a percentage of income or a fixed rate. Some franchisors require up to 70%.</span></p>
<h3><b>Differentiate from your competitors</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to minimizing business risks, you need to develop a strategy that makes you different from your competitors. Make it easy for your customers to reach you anywhere they are and book your services. </span><a href="https://partners.yclients.com/en" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YCLIENTS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allow you to automate your business and minimize costs by:</span></p>
<ul>
