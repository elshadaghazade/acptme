										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YCLIENTS aims to help you scale your business so you can focus on things you fancy doing. That’s why we have recently launched our new feature &#8211; online payments with Stripe! Stripe is the global leader in online payments. Stripe supports taking credit/debit card transactions online, safely and securely. Now, you can accept payments online right in your YCLIENTS booking form.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wondering what are the benefits of selling your services online? Here are the top reasons to start using online payments and grow your business:</span></p>
<h3><b>Receive prepayments for your services online &#8211; protect your precious time.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine if you pay for something in advance. You are more committed to this than when you are planning to go there just in your head. The same works for your clients: when they pay for services in advance or use their securely stored payment information for booking, they are more likely to follow your cancellation and no-shows policies. That’s a total win-win.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_4387" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4387" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-4387 size-large" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mokap_11-iphone-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Integrated Online Payments Stripe" width="800" height="534" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mokap_11-iphone-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mokap_11-iphone-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mokap_11-iphone-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mokap_11-iphone-1.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4387" class="wp-caption-text">Your customers can pay for services online while booking</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a client, unfortunately, still can’t make it to come, you are still able to protect yourself and set up cancellation fees. When returning the payment, apply this fee, and keep your business safe. You can do it with YCLIENTS online payment feature!</span></p>
<h3><b>Meet the new world and new standards: shopping online.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest events changed the way people do usual things and especially &#8211; their attitude to the online world. The </span><a href="https://www.marketingweek.com/how-covid-19-has-changed-shopper-behaviour/" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed a 21% increase in online orders in March 2020 vs March 2019, 41% of respondents said that they started to shop online for things they would normally shop for in-store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you do your business offline &#8211; customers are still willing to pay online. It is a trending habit which business owners should keep in mind.</span></p>
<h3><b>Protect yourself from fraud and keep track of your finances.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the fact Stripe makes the whole payment process 100% secure and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">stores credit card details in a PCI-compliant environment, it is also possible to detect suspicious payments with Stripe alerts. You can check these payments and refund them as a fraud if it is needed.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4388" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/adam-winger-thiqda3igm-unsplash-1024x684.jpg" alt="service payments online stripe" width="800" height="534" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/adam-winger-thiqda3igm-unsplash-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/adam-winger-thiqda3igm-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/adam-winger-thiqda3igm-unsplash-768x513.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, you can track all your online financial activities with Stripe payment reports.</span></p>
<h3><b>Accept payments in your preferred currencies internationally.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dealing with international customers? They can make payments in their own currency but you will receive payments in your preferred one. Stripe automatically convert it with a minimum fee. No additional headache &#8211; only a smoothly running business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take advantage of the online payment feature, and other </span><a href="https://www.yclients.com/en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YCLIENTS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> service-based business management tools, register for free, and get access to all features for 7 days!</span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most likely, you are purchasing consumables for your business (especially, if you are in the beauty business).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a significant expense item: for example, nail studios spend 8–9% of their turnover on nail polishes, cosmetics, and disposable tools. This process needs clear control over it to optimize your budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The objective of inventory management is to add transparency to your warehouse operations and allow you to fully control your daily inventory tracking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read below how to avoid the most common problems when it comes to inventory control:</span></p>
<h3>Save money and don&#8217;t order too much</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monitor how many consumables your employees use when delivering services. You need to calculate the volume of purchases accurately to plan your expenses accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, customers often book eyebrow dyeing service and rarely lash lamination. Consumables for both services were purchased in the same volume. By the time of the new purchase, the consumables for dyeing were almost over, but for lamination, they remained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using warehouse analytics, you can see which consumables are used more often and adjust your supplies accordingly. You can also launch a promotion for an unpopular service to use consumables faster.</span></p>
<h3>Prevent possible theft</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Track the movement of goods across 10 slices. Know how the consumables were used, how much is left, and how long they will last.</span></p>
<h3>Eliminate errors in accounting</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automatically write off consumables in the system when a client books an appointment for a certain service.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4481" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2-1024x512.png" alt="warehouse management system" width="800" height="400" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2-1024x512.png 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2-300x150.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine that your salon manager created an appointment for a client but forgot to specify the hair dye that a beautician will use to provide the service. Because of this, there was not enough dye for the next client, and at the end of the month, there was a shortfall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can restrict the appointment creation when there is a lack of consumables. Assign consumables to specific services &#8211; the goods will be automatically written off from the warehouse.</span></p>
<h3>Know which products are in the greatest and the lowest demand</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with the warehouse management system, you will see how many units are stored and keep track of the demand for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, your clients buy brand A for hair cosmetics more often than brand B &#8211; so much so that it is quickly sold out, and the second one is still there.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4482" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blake-wisz-gfrbmipod_e-unsplash-1024x683.jpg" alt="warehouse management software" width="800" height="534" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blake-wisz-gfrbmipod_e-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blake-wisz-gfrbmipod_e-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blake-wisz-gfrbmipod_e-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be able to follow this and make a decision &#8211; increase the purchase volume of cosmetics A in proportion to the demand, and reduce the volume of purchases B or sell off the rest at a discount to free up useful space in the warehouse.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With YCLIENTS, you can set up your warehouse management system in 5 easy steps and automate inventory tracking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add products</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open the </span><b>Warehouse &#8211; Products</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> section, create a category and add products to it.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4483" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-6-1024x512.png" alt="warehouse management system" width="800" height="400" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-6-1024x512.png 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-6-300x150.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-6-768x384.png 768w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-6.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create process charts</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go to the </span><b>Process charts</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and create lists of consumables for each service.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4484" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-7-1024x512.png" alt="warehouse management system" width="800" height="400" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-7-1024x512.png 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-7-300x150.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-7-768x384.png 768w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-7.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add services</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go to </span><b>Settings &#8211; Services</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, create categories, and add services to them.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4485" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-8-1024x512.png" alt="warehouse management system" width="800" height="400" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-8-1024x512.png 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-8-300x150.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-8-768x384.png 768w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-8.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add supplies to each service</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open the </span><b>Employees</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tab in the </span><b>Service</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> settings and add a process chart. When a customer books an appointment for a certain service, consumables will be written off automatically.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4486" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-9-1024x512.png" alt="warehouse management system" width="800" height="400" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-9-1024x512.png 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-9-300x150.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-9-768x384.png 768w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-9.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sell products to customers</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can indicate a sale right in the booking card or in the </span><b>Warehouse &#8211; Warehouse operations</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> section.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4487" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-10-1024x512.png" alt="warehouse management system" width="800" height="400" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-10-1024x512.png 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-10-300x150.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-10-768x384.png 768w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-10.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If people come to your company to get services, then most probably they are satisfied with the service costs, location, and reviews. But it does not guarantee that they will return again, even for a quality service. Perhaps the competitor will lower the price or hire a brilliant specialist, and next month your client will go there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create an emotional connection using client management software and visitors will come to you again. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take into consideration</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their preferences, draw up individual offers based on this, remind them of yourself by sending notifications, and simply stay in touch with them. <a href="https://www.yclients.com/en">YCLIENTS</a> tools — the </span><a href="https://www.yclients.com/en/client-base"><b>Client Database</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://www.yclients.com/en/sms-and-email-notification"><b>Notification Module</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — will do this job for you. Keep track of all clients using less annoying CRM and return them with marketing tools.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Save data of all your clients automatically</span></h2>
<h4><b>Client Database — a customer data platform</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When <a href="https://www.yclients.com/blog/en/managing-your-service-business-online-all-in-one-solution-for-online-scheduling/">creating an appointment</a>, a client’s name, contact information (phone and email), money spent, number, and dates of visits are added to the client base instantly. If necessary, you can edit it manually &#8211; for example, add actual or additional customers’ phone numbers.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_4291" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4291" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-4291 size-large" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-1024x625.png" alt="client database customer data platform" width="800" height="488" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-1024x625.png 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-300x183.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-768x469.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4291" class="wp-caption-text">Client Database</figcaption></figure>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make a discount system that benefits you</span></h2>
<h4><b>Automatic discount calculation</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set up the rules and client category &#8211; VIP, Loyal, Regular, or your custom one, and the discount for each client will be calculated automatically and displayed in the client base.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_4292" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4292" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-4292" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-1024x181.png" alt="client management software client base" width="800" height="141" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-1024x181.png 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-300x53.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-768x136.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4292" class="wp-caption-text">See all the discounts</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a client forgets a loyalty card, you can still give him or her a discount, and this will positively affect the loyalty to your services.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep a single customer base if your company has several branches</span></h2>
<h4><b>A single unified database for a chain</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simplify working with data and keep an eye on your audience: for instance, loyalty program members can visit different branches and get discounts everywhere.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_4293" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4293" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-4293" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-1024x396.png" alt="client base client management software" width="800" height="309" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-1024x396.png 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-300x116.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-768x297.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4293" class="wp-caption-text">Chain Client Database</figcaption></figure>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find customers you need instantly</span></h2>
<h4><b>Use filters for customer segmentation</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filter your visitors by birthday, frequency of visits, booking status, and more. This will help you to apply customer relationship marketing by creating special offers and sending them to your clients. For instance, create a special offer for birthdays or your regular customers, or identify customers who have not come to you for a month and send them a special offer which they can’t decline.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_4294" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4294" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-4294 size-large" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-1024x412.png" alt="customer segmentation client management software" width="800" height="322" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-1024x412.png 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-300x121.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-768x309.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4294" class="wp-caption-text">Customer segmentation with filters</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need to find one specific client, the Client Database provides a quick search by name, phone, email, or loyalty card number.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Send newsletters and notifications in a few clicks</span></h2>
<h4><b>Segment and select customers for automated text messages</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upload data to Excel, add as many client categories as you need. Send an automated text message.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_4295" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4295" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-4295 size-large" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5-1024x283.png" alt="client management software customer segmentation" width="800" height="221" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5-1024x283.png 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5-300x83.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5-768x212.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4295" class="wp-caption-text">Select clients from the database for mailing</figcaption></figure>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduce late arrivals by 60%</span></h2>
<h4><b>Notification Module</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With email, mobile and messenger appointment reminders, it is easier to follow the planned schedule and avoid conflict situations: visitors less likely will mix up appointment time if they get a reminder in advance. You don’t need to think about what to do with your next client’s booking. Moreover, an appointment reminder excludes the possibility of a situation when a client simply forgets about the scheduled booking.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_4296" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4296" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-4296" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/6-1024x600.png" alt="customer data platform appointment reminder" width="800" height="469" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/6-1024x600.png 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/6-300x176.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/6-768x450.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4296" class="wp-caption-text">Send messages with the Notification Module</figcaption></figure>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notify customers about promotions and discounts</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the notification module, you will automatically:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> get the opportunity to remind your customers about upcoming visits;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notify customers about confirmation, cancellation and booking transfers;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> request service feedback;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notify about bonuses and discounts;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> warn about the discount expiration;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> send newsletters about special offers;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wish a happy birthday and congratulate your customers with other holidays.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Save money on sending messages</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose mobile push notifications instead of SMS and reduce the cost of newsletters. Using a more profitable tool, you can send messages more often. This will increase the number of returned customers and help to keep them.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_4297" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4297" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-4297" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7-1024x600.png" alt="appointment reminder automated text message client management" width="800" height="469" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7-1024x600.png 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7-300x176.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7-768x450.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4297" class="wp-caption-text">Turn push notifications on</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can use all communication channels to be more efficient: push notifications, SMS, and email.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Address personally to each client</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use your own unique texts in notifications that emphasize your positioning. You can add customer names and company address to your messages. Here is an example of a personalized appointment reminder:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">% client_name%, we are waiting for you in% title% in% hour_minutes%. Our address:% address% and phone% phone%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All messages come on behalf of your brand.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promptly inform employees about shifts in the planned timing</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The module allows you to send notifications to your employees on:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">booking rescheduling (to administrators/managers and specialists);</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">booking cancelation (to administrators/managers and specialists);</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">incoming and missed calls.</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Use YCLIENTS tools, automate your business and save your time for more important tasks.</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People like to book online.</span><b> 25% of bookings</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> happen after your working hours or when it is inconvenient for clients to call. </span><b>42% of visitors</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who book online will book services more than 5 times provided by the same company.</span></p>
<h1><strong>Attract new customers through online booking on your website, in messengers and social networks</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YCLIENTS online booking widget allows you to add customers to the schedule without the participation of an administrator, after hours and without a need to call. Your client will be able to select a service, employee, convenient date and time in a few clicks. You can easily customize the widget design according to your corporate identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The booking widget is placed on your website and on social networks. This means that your client can check the price list, see which services you offer and immediately book without going to a separate page and a need to call the administrator.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having more than one service location? You can set up the online booking for different offices or salons. The widget will allow the client to select an address in the first step.</span></p>

<h1><strong>Save your time for more important tasks</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wondering how to perform basic tasks better and devote more time to your customers or more important things? Delegate boring tasks to YCLIENTS!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YCLIENTS Appointment Calendar is an online calendar where you can set up and change employee schedules, add, move, or delete appointments. When customers book your services online, their appointments will be automatically added to the calendar.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_4196" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4196" style="width: 870px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4196" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Group-2.png" alt="online appointment scheduling calendar widget" width="870" height="655" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Group-2.png 870w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Group-2-300x226.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Group-2-768x578.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4196" class="wp-caption-text">Online Appointment Scheduling Calendar</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know everything about your customers’ preferences. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">All information about customers and loyalty programs is stored in customer cards in the client database. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your administrator will be able to see the client’s card, the visit history, preferences, and statistics. Using this information, your employees can offer visitors suitable additional services or products.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The filter system will help you to select certain clients for targeted advertising mailing or just to see a list of “Lost” customers.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_4209" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4209" style="width: 986px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4209" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Group-13.png" alt="customer database online booking" width="986" height="656" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Group-13.png 986w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Group-13-300x200.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Group-13-768x511.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 986px) 100vw, 986px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4209" class="wp-caption-text">Client’s Card</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several people can work with the calendar at the same time from different devices: computers, tablets, or mobile phones. This will help you synchronize the work in different shifts and avoid overlaps in the schedule.</span></p>
<h1><strong>Manage your business with your mobile phone</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A mobile app for employees will increase the efficiency of your workers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using app your employees can create and close bookings, write off consumables, sell goods, and while you are on your way to work, for example, you can see brief analytics. The app for administrators has the same appointment calendar where the administrator can create a booking, reschedule it, leave a comment, and accept the payment.</span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opening a medical center is not an easy thing, but it is much more difficult to develop it correctly. Today, competition in this area has reached unprecedented heights. Everyone is trying to offer the best services at an affordable price. How to develop a medical center in such harsh conditions? What to pay attention to? This article will answer these important questions. Let’s consider the medical practice development in terms of promotion and attracting new customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is hardly possible to come up with something fundamentally new if you have a private clinic. The list of services and doctors remains unchanged from competitor to competitor, occasionally supplemented by new treatment methods and new specialists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, to ensure the systematic development of a private clinic, you need to think about how to properly and effectively use what you already have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some ways to attract visitors and increase the profitability of your medical business:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Invest in an online presence</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carefully think of your development strategy on social networks. This will help strengthen your online presence. Remember that more than 50% of all users today first search for information about services on the network, make their choice and only then come to the website. To generate more clients on the Internet, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Create a website if you do not already have one. You don’t need to hire a developer to do it. Simply use such services as <a href="https://tilda.cc/" rel="nofollow">Tilda</a>, <a href="https://wix.com/" rel="nofollow">WIX</a> or <a href="https://wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">WordPress</a>. Also, create pages in popular social networks</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where you possibly can find new customers: Facebook and Instagram. If the website has already been created, do not forget to optimize it: make a logical structure, add navigation, fill with high-quality content and speed it up.</span></p>
<p><strong>Don’t forget about SEO promotion for your website.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> To get started, create a SEO concept by selecting keywords relevant to your topic. Remember that keywords must be collected separately for each page! After that, add them to the finished website texts or create new content for the site &#8211; for instance, an article or any text for one landing page. This is necessary if you want your customers to easily find you in search engines. Collecting keywords and using them properly is not an easy task so you can hire a specialized agency to do it for you.</span></p>
<p><strong>Set up contextual advertising.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Create some powerful ads that will appear among the first three in the search engine when your potential customer searches for some medical services. Use </span><a href="https://skillshop.exceedlms.com/student/catalog/list?category_ids=53-google-ads?use_local=true" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Skillshop for Ads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to learn how to create ads. The most common search is “clinics near me” or “ *particular medical service* near me”. Do not forget to prepare the page in advance for the visitors: it should look perfect and convincing, otherwise, you can lose the interest of your potential clients.</span></p>
<p><strong>Engage in social media promotion.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Regularly fill your social pages with informative content. Publish more photos of real visitors, talk about the competence of your doctors, post the current schedule and promotions. Don’t forget about targeted advertising: this is a relatively inexpensive way to attract customers. The main thing is to choose the right audience to target to.</span></p>
<p><strong>Work with negatives and respond to positive reviews.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Not all the clients write reviews about their experience with your clinic only on your website or in specially designated places. They share their notes everywhere on the Internet! Your task is to find all possible references to your clinic, thank them for their kind words, and deal with cases that caused a negative. Reputation management is very important when it comes to retain clients and attract new ones.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Attract customers offline</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development of the medical practice center includes not only online activities. Good old offline methods also work:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advertise on local radio or tv-channels;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hand out flyers;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communicate at thematic conferences;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to get into the local media more often (but only on good occasions).</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Optimize medical practice management efficiently</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the above methods of the medical business development are aimed at attracting customers because they make up the basement of any ongoing business. However, there is another, more complex way to develop your clinic. It is based on the optimization of processes occurring within the company. This approach helps to increase work efficiency, reduce costs, and put the released funds into business development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, consider the following solutions to solve every medical practice management problems:</span></p>
<p><strong>A revision of the <a href="https://www.yclients.com/en/electronic-schedule">doctors’ schedule</a>.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Many specialists, especially narrowly targeted ones, do not need to constantly be in the clinic. They can come only on call, and you do not have to pay for their working hours.</span></p>

<p><strong>Competent <a href="https://www.yclients.com/en/finances-and-accounting">financial and accounting management</a>.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you do not understand where the money goes, developing a business can be tricky. Better to exclude human mistakes and delegate this task to medical practice software.</span></p>
<p><strong>Maintaining a customer base.</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Attracting a new customer is much more difficult than returning an old one. </span><a href="https://www.yclients.com/en/client-base"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collect a patient base</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and remember your patients. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communicate with them with SMS, email or in messengers efficiently. You can group clients, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for instance,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by their last visit date and the medical treatment they got, and send them special offers to get them back.</span></p>
<p><strong>Optimization of the booking process for your customers.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You can reduce the cost of maintaining the army of administrating managers and receptionists by simply installing the </span><a href="https://www.yclients.com/en/online-booking"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online booking widget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on your website or in socials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can simplify all this complex work on developing a medical practice center by optimizing processes using the YCLIENTS program  – an online booking software and all-in-one automation platform for service-based businesses.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current situation affected middle and small businesses all over the world. We are all in this together and still fighting for each other. But it doesn’t mean the virus impact on business is only negative! Yes, we can’t deny the financial problems everyone is facing now, but the crisis always makes you think of new ways to earn more or the ways to optimize your business when it is all over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things are definitely going to change. Soon your clients start coming back (yes they will!), it could be hard to manage your business with only pen and paper — it will only make it harder to grow your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, when everyone else is taking compelled break — be smarter and take your time to think of how you can increase your revenue after the crisis. You have the power to change, evolve and adapt to the current innovative times. See these times as an opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The traditional method of taking appointments typically looks like that: the client calling to book a service, waiting till someone there picks up the phone and only then your staff schedule this appointment. Quite time-consuming and sometimes really inconvenient, hah? How to step further and get those tech-savvy potential clients and also optimize all your routine to be more efficient and have more time for more important tasks after the quarantine when it is needed the most?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Need a solution? Pick any from the list!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>1. Let people book you online</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it was said before, time is changing – digital spreads wider to all types of businesses and the current crisis proved it. Buying and ordering services via a smartphone is a common thing. The possibility of <a href="https://www.yclients.com/en">online booking</a> is a great opportunity to demonstrate to your clients that you keep up with the time and to allow them to book your services wherever they are. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get new appointments 24/7 on your website, in messengers, socials or your branded app.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-4066 size-full" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dizajn-bez-nazvaniya-3.png" alt="online booking app" width="560" height="315" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dizajn-bez-nazvaniya-3.png 560w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dizajn-bez-nazvaniya-3-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schedule Calendar makes things even easier to control at ease: schedule, update and assign appointments to your employees in a few clicks. Your staff members will always have access to their schedules.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-4064 size-full" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dizajn-bez-nazvaniya-2.png" alt="appointment schedule calendar" width="560" height="315" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dizajn-bez-nazvaniya-2.png 560w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dizajn-bez-nazvaniya-2-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These measures lead to higher staff productivity – you and your team can spend less time on cumbersome tasks, and get higher-level jobs done much more efficiently excluding human errors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>2. Convert your customers into the loyal ones</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the lockdown times, only the strongest businesses will remain working and there will be even higher competition for the clients who, unfortunately, lost their previous place to get the services they need. Don’t cut your marketing costs as it is what helps your business running.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is time to be especially customer-oriented and find a solution that can easily store your customer preferences and personal notes, so you can track their service history and stay updated with their habits, likes, and dislikes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the collected information &#8211; group your clients and create a special communication strategy with them via email or SMS. Send them special offers or wish a happy birthday. Be nice!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>3. Reduce the number of no-shows or late arrivals and save your money</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our research at <a href="https://www.yclients.com/en">YCLIENTS</a> found that sending an appointment reminder reduced late arrivals by 60%. For this reason, it’s essential that you confirm, remind, and follow-up with customers who have booked a service.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-4065 size-full" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/push.png" alt="appointment reminder" width="734" height="264" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/push.png 734w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/push-300x108.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 734px) 100vw, 734px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t forget about the email communication! Let your clients know you are still there for them &#8211; send newsletters or just update them on how things are going.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When your business is open for visitors again, feel free to use this template to let your clients know they are welcome again:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Subject line:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Yay! We are here for you again!</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><em>Email body:</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi </span><strong>&lt;Name&gt; </strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just here to let you know that </span><strong>&lt;business name&gt;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is finally open. Despite the fact of these difficult times for all of us, we understand that there might be a need for what we do. If you’re up to, we’re here to serve you.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hygiene is an essential part of our work, but we have strengthened measures to comply with disinfection rules that prevent the spread of the pandemic. </span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re following these instructions to stay on the safe side: </span></em></p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frequent hand-washing;</span></em></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lots of tissues and sanitizers for your usage;</span></em></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gloves and face masks on during service;</span></em></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disinfecting tools and seats after each visitor.</span></em></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have traveled abroad or experiencing health issues, we still advise you to stay home and reschedule your appointment &#8211; we will be waiting for you. </span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking forward to have you again &#8211; feel free to book us online: </span><strong>&lt;Link&gt;</strong></em></p>
