										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YCLIENTS aims to help you scale your business so you can focus on things you fancy doing. That’s why we have recently launched our new feature &#8211; online payments with Stripe! Stripe is the global leader in online payments. Stripe supports taking credit/debit card transactions online, safely and securely. Now, you can accept payments online right in your YCLIENTS booking form.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wondering what are the benefits of selling your services online? Here are the top reasons to start using online payments and grow your business:</span></p>
<h3><b>Receive prepayments for your services online &#8211; protect your precious time.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine if you pay for something in advance. You are more committed to this than when you are planning to go there just in your head. The same works for your clients: when they pay for services in advance or use their securely stored payment information for booking, they are more likely to follow your cancellation and no-shows policies. That’s a total win-win.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_4387" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4387" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-4387 size-large" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mokap_11-iphone-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Integrated Online Payments Stripe" width="800" height="534" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mokap_11-iphone-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mokap_11-iphone-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mokap_11-iphone-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mokap_11-iphone-1.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4387" class="wp-caption-text">Your customers can pay for services online while booking</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a client, unfortunately, still can’t make it to come, you are still able to protect yourself and set up cancellation fees. When returning the payment, apply this fee, and keep your business safe. You can do it with YCLIENTS online payment feature!</span></p>
<h3><b>Meet the new world and new standards: shopping online.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest events changed the way people do usual things and especially &#8211; their attitude to the online world. The </span><a href="https://www.marketingweek.com/how-covid-19-has-changed-shopper-behaviour/" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed a 21% increase in online orders in March 2020 vs March 2019, 41% of respondents said that they started to shop online for things they would normally shop for in-store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you do your business offline &#8211; customers are still willing to pay online. It is a trending habit which business owners should keep in mind.</span></p>
<h3><b>Protect yourself from fraud and keep track of your finances.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the fact Stripe makes the whole payment process 100% secure and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">stores credit card details in a PCI-compliant environment, it is also possible to detect suspicious payments with Stripe alerts. You can check these payments and refund them as a fraud if it is needed.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4388" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/adam-winger-thiqda3igm-unsplash-1024x684.jpg" alt="service payments online stripe" width="800" height="534" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/adam-winger-thiqda3igm-unsplash-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/adam-winger-thiqda3igm-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/adam-winger-thiqda3igm-unsplash-768x513.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, you can track all your online financial activities with Stripe payment reports.</span></p>
<h3><b>Accept payments in your preferred currencies internationally.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dealing with international customers? They can make payments in their own currency but you will receive payments in your preferred one. Stripe automatically convert it with a minimum fee. No additional headache &#8211; only a smoothly running business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take advantage of the online payment feature, and other </span><a href="https://www.yclients.com/en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YCLIENTS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> service-based business management tools, register for free, and get access to all features for 7 days!</span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most likely, you are purchasing consumables for your business (especially, if you are in the beauty business).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a significant expense item: for example, nail studios spend 8–9% of their turnover on nail polishes, cosmetics, and disposable tools. This process needs clear control over it to optimize your budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The objective of inventory management is to add transparency to your warehouse operations and allow you to fully control your daily inventory tracking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read below how to avoid the most common problems when it comes to inventory control:</span></p>
<h3>Save money and don&#8217;t order too much</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monitor how many consumables your employees use when delivering services. You need to calculate the volume of purchases accurately to plan your expenses accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, customers often book eyebrow dyeing service and rarely lash lamination. Consumables for both services were purchased in the same volume. By the time of the new purchase, the consumables for dyeing were almost over, but for lamination, they remained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using warehouse analytics, you can see which consumables are used more often and adjust your supplies accordingly. You can also launch a promotion for an unpopular service to use consumables faster.</span></p>
<h3>Prevent possible theft</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Track the movement of goods across 10 slices. Know how the consumables were used, how much is left, and how long they will last.</span></p>
<h3>Eliminate errors in accounting</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automatically write off consumables in the system when a client books an appointment for a certain service.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4481" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2-1024x512.png" alt="warehouse management system" width="800" height="400" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2-1024x512.png 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2-300x150.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-2-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine that your salon manager created an appointment for a client but forgot to specify the hair dye that a beautician will use to provide the service. Because of this, there was not enough dye for the next client, and at the end of the month, there was a shortfall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can restrict the appointment creation when there is a lack of consumables. Assign consumables to specific services &#8211; the goods will be automatically written off from the warehouse.</span></p>
<h3>Know which products are in the greatest and the lowest demand</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with the warehouse management system, you will see how many units are stored and keep track of the demand for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, your clients buy brand A for hair cosmetics more often than brand B &#8211; so much so that it is quickly sold out, and the second one is still there.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4482" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blake-wisz-gfrbmipod_e-unsplash-1024x683.jpg" alt="warehouse management software" width="800" height="534" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blake-wisz-gfrbmipod_e-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blake-wisz-gfrbmipod_e-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blake-wisz-gfrbmipod_e-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be able to follow this and make a decision &#8211; increase the purchase volume of cosmetics A in proportion to the demand, and reduce the volume of purchases B or sell off the rest at a discount to free up useful space in the warehouse.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With YCLIENTS, you can set up your warehouse management system in 5 easy steps and automate inventory tracking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add products</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open the </span><b>Warehouse &#8211; Products</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> section, create a category and add products to it.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4483" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-6-1024x512.png" alt="warehouse management system" width="800" height="400" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-6-1024x512.png 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-6-300x150.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-6-768x384.png 768w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-6.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create process charts</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go to the </span><b>Process charts</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and create lists of consumables for each service.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4484" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-7-1024x512.png" alt="warehouse management system" width="800" height="400" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-7-1024x512.png 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-7-300x150.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-7-768x384.png 768w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-7.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add services</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go to </span><b>Settings &#8211; Services</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, create categories, and add services to them.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4485" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-8-1024x512.png" alt="warehouse management system" width="800" height="400" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-8-1024x512.png 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-8-300x150.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-8-768x384.png 768w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-8.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add supplies to each service</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open the </span><b>Employees</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tab in the </span><b>Service</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> settings and add a process chart. When a customer books an appointment for a certain service, consumables will be written off automatically.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4486" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-9-1024x512.png" alt="warehouse management system" width="800" height="400" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-9-1024x512.png 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-9-300x150.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-9-768x384.png 768w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-9.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sell products to customers</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can indicate a sale right in the booking card or in the </span><b>Warehouse &#8211; Warehouse operations</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> section.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4487" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-10-1024x512.png" alt="warehouse management system" width="800" height="400" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-10-1024x512.png 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-10-300x150.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-10-768x384.png 768w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/file-cover-10.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6><strong>Dalma Etter is a founder and co-owner of the Eyelash Clinic &#8211; the largest lash extension studio in Budapest. Her sister used to be in touch with the guests manually and arranged appointments until she encountered a new life challenge: the pleasures of maternity.</strong></h6>
<h6><strong>Dalma had to figure something out urgently. Fortunately, she found out about YCLIENTS &#8211; an online booking and appointment scheduling system for the beauty industry. YCLIENTS operates globally and has successfully developing <a href="https://www.yclients.com/hu">partners in Hungary</a>. </strong></h6>
<h6><strong>We talked with Dalma about her growing business and how YCLIENTS helped her with that.</strong></h6>

<p><strong>– Hi, Dalma! So, tell us about the very beginning of your business?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started doing eyelash extensions 11 years ago alone and have been growing steadily ever since. When the number of my clients outgrew me, I had to involve my sister. As time went on, our guests fell in love with us so much that we had to expand our team: more and more people joined us. Then, as the number of stylists increased, so did the number of our guests, it became more and more difficult to schedule guests manually.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><b>As soon as the number of clients grew, it became extremely difficult to deal with appointment scheduling</b></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>– Now, we are sitting in a beautiful and extremely clean salon but you have just moved in.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We moved in two years ago. We worked in a previous salon for almost 10 years. We had a business plan: we calculated that if two of us (me and my sister) still worked and we hired two stylists after we had moved in, we could continue running our business smoothly. At that time, stylists arranged their upcoming appointments with their guests themselves. But when the day of the move came, two employees said they would rather stay, and since they communicated with their own guests, the guests also stayed with them. Therefore, unfortunately, we lost 50% of our customers at that time.</span></p>
<p><strong>– What could you do about this? How did you prevent that later on?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have introduced a different system in our new salon by which the guests could only book appointments via phone of the Eyelash Clinic and we also gave them an appointment upon departure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this system put a huge burden on my sister: keeping in touch with 130-200 people, arranging dates including weekends and holidays.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><b>We simply love it!</b></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>-Did your sister keep the appointments on paper?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, or via Google Calendar. Each stylist had a color and we arranged guests based on that. However, scheduling, modifying, and canceling process was almost non-stop work for her, which was quite stressful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then she got pregnant so I knew that she would leave us soon. That was the moment I decided to look for <a href="https://www.yclients.com/blog/en/managing-your-service-business-online-all-in-one-solution-for-online-scheduling/">an online booking and scheduling system</a>. And we found YCLIENTS. Since February, you can schedule an appointment only online and we simply love it!</span></p>

<p><strong>– Only online or you combine it with the traditional paperwork?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guests can still book via phone because I see that they need an extra connection. The young people, who had previously booked appointments via Instagram, got used to it sooner. And for the senior guests, who would have had trouble switching, we allowed booking appointments in person or via phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, since we provide a special service, I call every new guest, whether they booked online or in person, and ask them if they have any allergies or did lash extensions before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the service had not become impersonal by using YCLIENTS as the contact is maintained. All we have to do is invest less energy and time.</span></p>
<p><strong>– How did the guests welcome it?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were happy about it. They are happy with all the novelties. They love changes and felt this would be a positive step forward. By the way, I can say that 80% of our guests manage their appointments online and only 20% insist on their next appointment to be arranged before leaving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, we have a new client who said she only choose a salon where she can book online.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><b>I cannot imagine how it would be without YCLIENTS</b></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>– Was the switching to the system troublesome?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was some transition, as the YCLIENTS calendar works according to a different logic than the Google calendar: there everyone had a different color, while here the stylists have separate calendars with their name and photo on it. Plus, thanks to YCLIENTS app, everyone can see their schedule on their phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And guess what: when the first guest booked her appointment online, we remembered her name (learn <a href="https://www.yclients.com/blog/en/manage-your-service-business-online-how-to-keep-your-customers-and-avoid-losing-them/">here</a> how) and celebrated it as she entered the doors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have to say, I can’t imagine what it would be like without the YCLIENTS.</span></p>
<p><strong>– Do the stylists like it? Have they got used to it quickly?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our specialists can see and track their work schedules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, as an owner, I can decide what my employees can see from the entire system. I decide how much burden I take off of my shoulders by giving them as many opportunities as they need to fully use the calendar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can see the calendar anywhere and anytime, the guests who came, who paid, who booked, and how busy the stylists were. Even when I’m away on vacation, everything works smoothly with the system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are countless ways I can see how much money a certain stylist accumulated and what costs we have. What I’ve put into perspective, but haven’t gotten to that point yet, is stock replenishment, which I think will be a huge step forward.</span></p>
<p><strong>– What if you get stuck in with something?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I call customer service. They are always very helpful. Jokes aside, it was a huge help that customer service was also available at the very beginning, whatever question arose about the setup.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><b>I was able to notify everyone with a few clicks</b></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>– What are the greatest advantages?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a new guest calls while I am working on someone’s lashes, I don&#8217;t have to stop my work and flip through calendars to see which stylist has free time and when.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system automatically enters the guest&#8217;s phone number next to the appointment, thus significantly shortens the booking flow. By this, I mean that if someone is late, a stylist has their phone number, because before only me had all the guest numbers. They can call the guest without asking me to be so kind and check with the guest if she is coming for the appointment.</span></p>
<p><strong>– Which one is your favorite function?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I like being able to send automatic SMS or emails to all guests. When the salon had to be closed in mid-March due to the coronavirus epidemic, we had to draft a single message and circulate it. And when I reopened, I also didn’t have to write the SMS individually, but I was able to notify everyone in a few clicks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, a reminder sent 24-hours before the appointment is also a good thing because many people forget their appointment date. If we remind them a day before, they are more likely to come.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4464" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/facebook-post-7-1024x538.png" alt="appointment notifications booking reminder" width="800" height="420" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/facebook-post-7-1024x538.png 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/facebook-post-7-300x158.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/facebook-post-7-768x403.png 768w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/facebook-post-7-390x205.png 390w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/facebook-post-7.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p><strong>– Do you think it is a good cost?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though I’m not a financial genius, I’m sure it is. And it brings a lot of benefits. But if you ask specifically, I would say that by the number of bookings taken with YCLIENTS I have already got back the cost of it.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><b>The number of guests increased without marketing</b></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>– Did the revenue also increase since you are using YCLIENTS?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our profits increased as we saved costs and became more efficient. All services, working hours, and prices have also become transparent and clear. Not to mention that we’ve also reached some visitors we certainly wouldn’t have been able without online booking.</span></p>
<p><b>–</b><strong> Since you don’t have a receptionist, I think expenses have also dropped…</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s right. When you work alone, you free up your own time, which you can spend on productive work or your family or even rest. And if you work with others, you can save on receptionist work and costs with YCLIENTS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, we didn&#8217;t have to create a separate website, we just added the Book Now button to our existing Facebook and Instagram pages, and people could see available dates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, with YCLIENTS we could get new guests without any effort or advertising: we reached out to new people without spending on marketing, so whoever got to our social pages became a guest in most cases because they could make an appointment with us right away. If they had to call us instead, not sure they would actually reach us; I’m talking about if a guest finds our socials on the weekend or just at night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a step forward for us that didn’t require much investment, yet we were able to bring more guests to the salon.</span></p>
<p><strong>– So, does this mean that if you could go back to Google calendar this all wouldn’t be possible? </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absolutely not possible. By no, I mean that online appointment booking is a service that absolutely sets us apart from the competition. Plus, it’s a cool thing, and being cool is really good for your business!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If people come to your company to get services, then most probably they are satisfied with the service costs, location, and reviews. But it does not guarantee that they will return again, even for a quality service. Perhaps the competitor will lower the price or hire a brilliant specialist, and next month your client will go there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create an emotional connection using client management software and visitors will come to you again. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take into consideration</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their preferences, draw up individual offers based on this, remind them of yourself by sending notifications, and simply stay in touch with them. <a href="https://www.yclients.com/en">YCLIENTS</a> tools — the </span><a href="https://www.yclients.com/en/client-base"><b>Client Database</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://www.yclients.com/en/sms-and-email-notification"><b>Notification Module</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — will do this job for you. Keep track of all clients using less annoying CRM and return them with marketing tools.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Save data of all your clients automatically</span></h2>
<h4><b>Client Database — a customer data platform</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When <a href="https://www.yclients.com/blog/en/managing-your-service-business-online-all-in-one-solution-for-online-scheduling/">creating an appointment</a>, a client’s name, contact information (phone and email), money spent, number, and dates of visits are added to the client base instantly. If necessary, you can edit it manually &#8211; for example, add actual or additional customers’ phone numbers.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_4291" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4291" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-4291 size-large" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-1024x625.png" alt="client database customer data platform" width="800" height="488" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-1024x625.png 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-300x183.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-768x469.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4291" class="wp-caption-text">Client Database</figcaption></figure>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make a discount system that benefits you</span></h2>
<h4><b>Automatic discount calculation</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set up the rules and client category &#8211; VIP, Loyal, Regular, or your custom one, and the discount for each client will be calculated automatically and displayed in the client base.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_4292" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4292" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-4292" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-1024x181.png" alt="client management software client base" width="800" height="141" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-1024x181.png 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-300x53.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-768x136.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4292" class="wp-caption-text">See all the discounts</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a client forgets a loyalty card, you can still give him or her a discount, and this will positively affect the loyalty to your services.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep a single customer base if your company has several branches</span></h2>
<h4><b>A single unified database for a chain</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simplify working with data and keep an eye on your audience: for instance, loyalty program members can visit different branches and get discounts everywhere.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_4293" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4293" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-4293" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-1024x396.png" alt="client base client management software" width="800" height="309" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-1024x396.png 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-300x116.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-768x297.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4293" class="wp-caption-text">Chain Client Database</figcaption></figure>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find customers you need instantly</span></h2>
<h4><b>Use filters for customer segmentation</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filter your visitors by birthday, frequency of visits, booking status, and more. This will help you to apply customer relationship marketing by creating special offers and sending them to your clients. For instance, create a special offer for birthdays or your regular customers, or identify customers who have not come to you for a month and send them a special offer which they can’t decline.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need to find one specific client, the Client Database provides a quick search by name, phone, email, or loyalty card number.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Send newsletters and notifications in a few clicks</span></h2>
<h4><b>Segment and select customers for automated text messages</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upload data to Excel, add as many client categories as you need. Send an automated text message.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_4295" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4295" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-4295 size-large" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5-1024x283.png" alt="client management software customer segmentation" width="800" height="221" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5-1024x283.png 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5-300x83.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5-768x212.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4295" class="wp-caption-text">Select clients from the database for mailing</figcaption></figure>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduce late arrivals by 60%</span></h2>
<h4><b>Notification Module</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With email, mobile and messenger appointment reminders, it is easier to follow the planned schedule and avoid conflict situations: visitors less likely will mix up appointment time if they get a reminder in advance. You don’t need to think about what to do with your next client’s booking. Moreover, an appointment reminder excludes the possibility of a situation when a client simply forgets about the scheduled booking.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_4296" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4296" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-4296" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/6-1024x600.png" alt="customer data platform appointment reminder" width="800" height="469" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/6-1024x600.png 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/6-300x176.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/6-768x450.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4296" class="wp-caption-text">Send messages with the Notification Module</figcaption></figure>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notify customers about promotions and discounts</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the notification module, you will automatically:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> get the opportunity to remind your customers about upcoming visits;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notify customers about confirmation, cancellation and booking transfers;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> request service feedback;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notify about bonuses and discounts;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> warn about the discount expiration;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> send newsletters about special offers;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wish a happy birthday and congratulate your customers with other holidays.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Save money on sending messages</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose mobile push notifications instead of SMS and reduce the cost of newsletters. Using a more profitable tool, you can send messages more often. This will increase the number of returned customers and help to keep them.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_4297" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4297" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-4297" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7-1024x600.png" alt="appointment reminder automated text message client management" width="800" height="469" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7-1024x600.png 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7-300x176.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7-768x450.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4297" class="wp-caption-text">Turn push notifications on</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can use all communication channels to be more efficient: push notifications, SMS, and email.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Address personally to each client</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use your own unique texts in notifications that emphasize your positioning. You can add customer names and company address to your messages. Here is an example of a personalized appointment reminder:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">% client_name%, we are waiting for you in% title% in% hour_minutes%. Our address:% address% and phone% phone%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All messages come on behalf of your brand.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promptly inform employees about shifts in the planned timing</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The module allows you to send notifications to your employees on:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">booking rescheduling (to administrators/managers and specialists);</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">booking cancelation (to administrators/managers and specialists);</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People like to book online.</span><b> 25% of bookings</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> happen after your working hours or when it is inconvenient for clients to call. </span><b>42% of visitors</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who book online will book services more than 5 times provided by the same company.</span></p>
<h1><strong>Attract new customers through online booking on your website, in messengers and social networks</strong></h1>

<h1><strong>Save your time for more important tasks</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wondering how to perform basic tasks better and devote more time to your customers or more important things? Delegate boring tasks to YCLIENTS!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YCLIENTS Appointment Calendar is an online calendar where you can set up and change employee schedules, add, move, or delete appointments. When customers book your services online, their appointments will be automatically added to the calendar.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_4196" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4196" style="width: 870px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4196" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Group-2.png" alt="online appointment scheduling calendar widget" width="870" height="655" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Group-2.png 870w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Group-2-300x226.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Group-2-768x578.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4196" class="wp-caption-text">Online Appointment Scheduling Calendar</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know everything about your customers’ preferences. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">All information about customers and loyalty programs is stored in customer cards in the client database. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your administrator will be able to see the client’s card, the visit history, preferences, and statistics. Using this information, your employees can offer visitors suitable additional services or products.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The filter system will help you to select certain clients for targeted advertising mailing or just to see a list of “Lost” customers.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_4209" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4209" style="width: 986px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4209" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Group-13.png" alt="customer database online booking" width="986" height="656" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Group-13.png 986w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Group-13-300x200.png 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Group-13-768x511.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 986px) 100vw, 986px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4209" class="wp-caption-text">Client’s Card</figcaption></figure>

<h1><strong>Manage your business with your mobile phone</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A mobile app for employees will increase the efficiency of your workers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using app your employees can create and close bookings, write off consumables, sell goods, and while you are on your way to work, for example, you can see brief analytics. The app for administrators has the same appointment calendar where the administrator can create a booking, reschedule it, leave a comment, and accept the payment.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opening a medical center is not an easy thing, but it is much more difficult to develop it correctly. Today, competition in this area has reached unprecedented heights. Everyone is trying to offer the best services at an affordable price. How to develop a medical center in such harsh conditions? What to pay attention to? This article will answer these important questions. Let’s consider the medical practice development in terms of promotion and attracting new customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is hardly possible to come up with something fundamentally new if you have a private clinic. The list of services and doctors remains unchanged from competitor to competitor, occasionally supplemented by new treatment methods and new specialists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, to ensure the systematic development of a private clinic, you need to think about how to properly and effectively use what you already have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some ways to attract visitors and increase the profitability of your medical business:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Invest in an online presence</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carefully think of your development strategy on social networks. This will help strengthen your online presence. Remember that more than 50% of all users today first search for information about services on the network, make their choice and only then come to the website. To generate more clients on the Internet, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Create a website if you do not already have one. You don’t need to hire a developer to do it. Simply use such services as <a href="https://tilda.cc/" rel="nofollow">Tilda</a>, <a href="https://wix.com/" rel="nofollow">WIX</a> or <a href="https://wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">WordPress</a>. Also, create pages in popular social networks</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where you possibly can find new customers: Facebook and Instagram. If the website has already been created, do not forget to optimize it: make a logical structure, add navigation, fill with high-quality content and speed it up.</span></p>
<p><strong>Don’t forget about SEO promotion for your website.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> To get started, create a SEO concept by selecting keywords relevant to your topic. Remember that keywords must be collected separately for each page! After that, add them to the finished website texts or create new content for the site &#8211; for instance, an article or any text for one landing page. This is necessary if you want your customers to easily find you in search engines. Collecting keywords and using them properly is not an easy task so you can hire a specialized agency to do it for you.</span></p>
<p><strong>Set up contextual advertising.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Create some powerful ads that will appear among the first three in the search engine when your potential customer searches for some medical services. Use </span><a href="https://skillshop.exceedlms.com/student/catalog/list?category_ids=53-google-ads?use_local=true" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Skillshop for Ads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to learn how to create ads. The most common search is “clinics near me” or “ *particular medical service* near me”. Do not forget to prepare the page in advance for the visitors: it should look perfect and convincing, otherwise, you can lose the interest of your potential clients.</span></p>
<p><strong>Engage in social media promotion.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Regularly fill your social pages with informative content. Publish more photos of real visitors, talk about the competence of your doctors, post the current schedule and promotions. Don’t forget about targeted advertising: this is a relatively inexpensive way to attract customers. The main thing is to choose the right audience to target to.</span></p>
<p><strong>Work with negatives and respond to positive reviews.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Not all the clients write reviews about their experience with your clinic only on your website or in specially designated places. They share their notes everywhere on the Internet! Your task is to find all possible references to your clinic, thank them for their kind words, and deal with cases that caused a negative. Reputation management is very important when it comes to retain clients and attract new ones.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Attract customers offline</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development of the medical practice center includes not only online activities. Good old offline methods also work:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advertise on local radio or tv-channels;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hand out flyers;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communicate at thematic conferences;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to get into the local media more often (but only on good occasions).</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Optimize medical practice management efficiently</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the above methods of the medical business development are aimed at attracting customers because they make up the basement of any ongoing business. However, there is another, more complex way to develop your clinic. It is based on the optimization of processes occurring within the company. This approach helps to increase work efficiency, reduce costs, and put the released funds into business development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, consider the following solutions to solve every medical practice management problems:</span></p>
<p><strong>A revision of the <a href="https://www.yclients.com/en/electronic-schedule">doctors’ schedule</a>.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Many specialists, especially narrowly targeted ones, do not need to constantly be in the clinic. They can come only on call, and you do not have to pay for their working hours.</span></p>

<p><strong>Competent <a href="https://www.yclients.com/en/finances-and-accounting">financial and accounting management</a>.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you do not understand where the money goes, developing a business can be tricky. Better to exclude human mistakes and delegate this task to medical practice software.</span></p>
<p><strong>Maintaining a customer base.</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Attracting a new customer is much more difficult than returning an old one. </span><a href="https://www.yclients.com/en/client-base"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collect a patient base</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and remember your patients. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communicate with them with SMS, email or in messengers efficiently. You can group clients, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for instance,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by their last visit date and the medical treatment they got, and send them special offers to get them back.</span></p>
<p><strong>Optimization of the booking process for your customers.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You can reduce the cost of maintaining the army of administrating managers and receptionists by simply installing the </span><a href="https://www.yclients.com/en/online-booking"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online booking widget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on your website or in socials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can simplify all this complex work on developing a medical practice center by optimizing processes using the YCLIENTS program  – an online booking software and all-in-one automation platform for service-based businesses.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current situation affected middle and small businesses all over the world. We are all in this together and still fighting for each other. But it doesn’t mean the virus impact on business is only negative! Yes, we can’t deny the financial problems everyone is facing now, but the crisis always makes you think of new ways to earn more or the ways to optimize your business when it is all over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things are definitely going to change. Soon your clients start coming back (yes they will!), it could be hard to manage your business with only pen and paper — it will only make it harder to grow your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, when everyone else is taking compelled break — be smarter and take your time to think of how you can increase your revenue after the crisis. You have the power to change, evolve and adapt to the current innovative times. See these times as an opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The traditional method of taking appointments typically looks like that: the client calling to book a service, waiting till someone there picks up the phone and only then your staff schedule this appointment. Quite time-consuming and sometimes really inconvenient, hah? How to step further and get those tech-savvy potential clients and also optimize all your routine to be more efficient and have more time for more important tasks after the quarantine when it is needed the most?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Need a solution? Pick any from the list!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>1. Let people book you online</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it was said before, time is changing – digital spreads wider to all types of businesses and the current crisis proved it. Buying and ordering services via a smartphone is a common thing. The possibility of <a href="https://www.yclients.com/en">online booking</a> is a great opportunity to demonstrate to your clients that you keep up with the time and to allow them to book your services wherever they are. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get new appointments 24/7 on your website, in messengers, socials or your branded app.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-4066 size-full" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dizajn-bez-nazvaniya-3.png" alt="online booking app" width="560" height="315" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dizajn-bez-nazvaniya-3.png 560w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dizajn-bez-nazvaniya-3-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schedule Calendar makes things even easier to control at ease: schedule, update and assign appointments to your employees in a few clicks. Your staff members will always have access to their schedules.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-4064 size-full" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dizajn-bez-nazvaniya-2.png" alt="appointment schedule calendar" width="560" height="315" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dizajn-bez-nazvaniya-2.png 560w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dizajn-bez-nazvaniya-2-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These measures lead to higher staff productivity – you and your team can spend less time on cumbersome tasks, and get higher-level jobs done much more efficiently excluding human errors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>2. Convert your customers into the loyal ones</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the lockdown times, only the strongest businesses will remain working and there will be even higher competition for the clients who, unfortunately, lost their previous place to get the services they need. Don’t cut your marketing costs as it is what helps your business running.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is time to be especially customer-oriented and find a solution that can easily store your customer preferences and personal notes, so you can track their service history and stay updated with their habits, likes, and dislikes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the collected information &#8211; group your clients and create a special communication strategy with them via email or SMS. Send them special offers or wish a happy birthday. Be nice!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>3. Reduce the number of no-shows or late arrivals and save your money</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our research at <a href="https://www.yclients.com/en">YCLIENTS</a> found that sending an appointment reminder reduced late arrivals by 60%. For this reason, it’s essential that you confirm, remind, and follow-up with customers who have booked a service.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-4065 size-full" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/push.png" alt="appointment reminder" width="734" height="264" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/push.png 734w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/push-300x108.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 734px) 100vw, 734px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t forget about the email communication! Let your clients know you are still there for them &#8211; send newsletters or just update them on how things are going.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When your business is open for visitors again, feel free to use this template to let your clients know they are welcome again:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Subject line:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Yay! We are here for you again!</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><em>Email body:</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi </span><strong>&lt;Name&gt; </strong></em></p>

Despite the fact of these difficult times for all of us, we understand that there might be a need for what we do. If you’re up to, we’re here to serve you.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hygiene is an essential part of our work, but we have strengthened measures to comply with disinfection rules that prevent the spread of the pandemic. </span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re following these instructions to stay on the safe side: </span></em></p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frequent hand-washing;</span></em></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lots of tissues and sanitizers for your usage;</span></em></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gloves and face masks on during service;</span></em></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disinfecting tools and seats after each visitor.</span></em></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have traveled abroad or experiencing health issues, we still advise you to stay home and reschedule your appointment &#8211; we will be waiting for you. </span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking forward to have you again &#8211; feel free to book us online: </span><strong>&lt;Link&gt;</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your </span><strong>&lt;Business name&gt;</strong></em></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opening a beauty salon is only half the battle. Competent management is no less important here. As a beauty salon owner, you should pay attention to every detail and not let anything drift. Otherwise, you may encounter unsatisfied customers, poor quality service, inspections by supervisory authorities and profit loss.</span></p>
<h3><b>Beauty salon management involves monitoring:</b></h3>
<p><strong>Ongoing expenses and revenue.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It is necessary to fix these indicators and double-check all documents daily. Pay particular attention to excessing income (more than 30%) or expenses (more than 20%).</span></p>
<p><strong>Primary expense documentation.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Financial management of a beauty salon is best left to the accountant or the director himself. If you constantly monitor all the indicators, you can timely identify inappropriate spending, theft and much more.</span></p>
<p><strong>The individual dynamics of masters’ performance.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It allows you to identify the most productive employees and those who are least interested in professional development.</span></p>
<h3><b>Build an effective beauty management system</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The profitability of a beauty salon depends largely on the position of the business owner. To achieve your business goals, you cannot do without an interesting concept and a detailed plan for implementing the strategy. If there is no clear control system, then the owner of a beauty salon runs the risk of facing following problems:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a lack of interest of employees in the business development of the salon.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">non-observance of discipline and company charter.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">incorrect management actions that interfere with business development, or lack thereof.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Try effective ways to get more clients</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to successful sales in the beauty business is the availability of regular customers. Effective beauty salon management implies the organization of a customer-oriented service. In this case, it refers to the creation of a marketing plan, a loyalty program, special offers, etc. Marketing in the beauty industry is one of the most powerful ways to attract new clients and retain old ones.</span></p>
<h3><b>How to manage a beauty salon without experience?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the following tips:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Do a little more for your customers than what they expect.</strong> Attentive and friendly attitude to visitors will help to build trust between your brand and your customers. In case of some minor misunderstandings, those clients will always be a little bit more loyal and will less likely spread negative reviews.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Better not impose additional services to the real or potential client.</strong> This can cause a negative reaction. Optimally, if you or your employees take an interest in what else you could help him or her and suggest accordingly their real needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tell only the truth about the services offered.</strong> If you embellish the result and the client receives not what is expected, the reputation of your salon will be tarnished, and the visitor is unlikely to return again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Do not forget to pamper your regular customers.</strong> Make a discount or provide some service as a gift. This approach will be the key to the client’s heart, he or she will remember this and come back to your salon once again.</span></p>
<h3><b>How to get more appointments right at the beginning?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://partners.yclients.com/en" rel="nofollow">YCLIENTS software</a> will help automate business processes and build a customer-oriented service. How?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using YCLIENTS, you can let people book an appointment with a hairdresser, make-up artist, nail master online. Today, most people spend their time on the Internet.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dentistry is one of the most favorable areas for investments, but with high competition. In every city, there are dozens of dental centers: from modest dental offices to large network clinics. To stay afloat, it is necessary to know how to attract patients to the dental clinic efficiently.</span></p>
<h3><b>Here are 6 effective points to consider when attracting dental patients:</b></h3>
<h4><b>Location</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be a winner, it is not necessary to have an office in the city center. It is important that the hospital is conveniently accessible by public and private transport.</span></p>
<h4><b>The personnel competence</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professionalism, accuracy, and cleanliness of a personnel are visible from the first minute of the meeting. If a doctor started a patient examination without gloves, and during treatment caused discomfort, the client is unlikely to make an appointment again. You can also attract patients by treating complex diseases, conducting rare operations, using experimental but reliable techniques.</span></p>
<h4><b>Offline and online advertising</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to attract patients to the dentistry that has just opened? At first, only online and street advertisement will work. Use any tools: flyers, banners, billboards, websites, social networks. Later, patients will hopefully come via word of mouth.</span></p>
<h4><b>Marketing campaigns</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discounts, promotions, and special offers have always been an effective way to attract patients to dentistry. Reduced prices will help expand the audience among students and retirees. Try to go viral with exceptional quality of service or interesting marketing offers &#8211; for instance, first free visit for new clients or 20% discount if a patient refers to anyone else.</span></p>
<h4><b>Feedback</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the provision of the service, doctors should ask clients if they are satisfied with everything. You can ask to leave feedback on the website or on the company&#8217;s page in social networks. Or encourage them to do it with special offers for their next visits.</span></p>
<h4><b>Automated service</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making an appointment with a doctor through the registry is becoming less and less relevant &#8211; your clients use computers or telephones to make it very convenient and time-saving. </span><a href="https://partners.yclients.com/en" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online booking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an efficient way to get an appointment in a few clicks. Busy people do not need to leave work to come to the hospital and make an appointment with a doctor, and introverts do not have to call &#8211; let them book your services online.</span></p>
<h3><b>Attracting corporate clients in dentistry</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corporate clients for dentistry are a gold mine for a business. One company can bring an average of 10-15 clients to the clinic. There are two ways to increase client flow to dentistry by proposing:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">corporate subscription for employees;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signing a service contract at a discount.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In both cases, the dental clinic receives a significant influx of customers, and the head of the company demonstrates care for its employees. You can contact the owners of companies by phone or e-mail, sending a commercial offer.</span></p>
<h3><b>Automate your dentistry business</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the ways to attract clients to dentistry allows you to keep them and convert them into regular visitors. However, to make your clinic even more modern and convenient for patients, it is advisable to automate the basic processes of your everyday routine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This can be done by the cloud platform </span><a href="https://partners.yclients.com/en" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YCLIENTS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is attached to the website and allows you to solve numerous problems for both visitors and clinic staff.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_4036" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4036" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-4036 size-large" src="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Group-26-1-1024x702.jpg" alt="appointment scheduling calendar" width="800" height="548" srcset="https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Group-26-1-1024x702.jpg 1024w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Group-26-1-300x206.jpg 300w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Group-26-1-768x527.jpg 768w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Group-26-1-130x90.jpg 130w, https://www.yclients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Group-26-1.jpg 1218w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4036" class="wp-caption-text">Use Appointment Schedule Tool to manage your entire clinic</figcaption></figure>
<p><b>Online booking.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Patients can get to the dentist with a few clicks. They only need to choose a doctor, date and convenient time, and then fill their phone number and email in.</span></p>
<p><b>Appointment calendar.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It’s enough for a doctor to have a phone on hand to find out his schedule. YCLIENTS automatically records all client data, which are then displayed by the clinic staff in their appointment calendar.</span></p>
<p><b>SMS and email alerts</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Set up automatic sending of notifications to the customer’s email or phone a couple of days before receiving it. So the patient will definitely not miss a trip to the doctor, and you will not have windows in the schedule.</span></p>
<p><b>Customer database.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This function allows you to increase the customer focus of your dental clinic. You can easily track the frequency of visits. For regular customers this way you can develop personalized discounts and increase their loyalty. For those who are new, organize a newsletter with all your clinic updates and important information or offers.</span></p>
<p><strong>YCLIENTS will ensure the guaranteed involvement of primary patients in dentistry and turn them into regular customers of your clinic!</strong></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business in sports and health is a promising new business option. But before you open a fitness studio from scratch, it is important to calculate the cost of future investments, draw up a business plan, determine a management and promotion strategy so that the invested funds pay off as quickly as possible. Be sure to analyze your competitors and potential clients. Try to find your competitive advantage and find a way to minimize your costs. So you will understand whether it is profitable to open a fitness club and worth doing in your area.</span></p>
<h3><b>Consider the legal stuff</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you open a fitness club, you do need to be aware of all the legal issues on your local regulations. Usually, a certain set of documents is needed:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">registration documents of the legal form of business (for instance, LLC);</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">lease/ purchase agreement for sport equipment;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">permission of fire and sanitary inspections;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">conform to the standards set by a local health organization (for instance, in the UK it is Health and Safety Executive (HSE)).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the country you are opening your fitness business in, there are also certain insurance requirements like Professional indemnity insurance for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fitness instructors </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and so. </span></p>
<h3><b>Calculate the main costs</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not borrow money and do not spend personal savings until you have precisely calculated how much it costs to open a fitness club from scratch in your case. Costs are directly dependent on the scope and concept of the project. But for any fitness room, the main expense items are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">rental/purchase agreement;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">leasing/purchase of fitness and sport equipment;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">staff salary;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">tax deductions;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">installation of fire safety systems, ventilation, air conditioning;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">utility payments;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">phone and Internet costs.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Find your target audience</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of opening your fitness room from scratch largely depends on your clients’ ability to pay. Keep this in mind and establish pricing policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can count on a narrow segment, for example, open children&#8217;s fitness, or combine classes for different groups. This directly affects the choice of equipment. For example, to open a fitness studio for women, you are unlikely to need powerful fitness equipment for bodybuilders. But it’s probably worth buying treadmills, exercise bikes, stretching equipment, low and medium power loads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is highly advisable to decide in advance whether it is worth opening a fitness room for group training for aerobics, gymnastics, yoga, etc. This decision affects the layout and the required amount of free space. On average, in group classes, there are 2 square meters per client and 3 square meters per coach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that the new fitness business has more potential for success with the exclusive training type, in which there are almost no competitors. This can be a trampoline center, gymnastics in hammocks, EMS-training, etc. Although with the right business approach, a classic fitness studio can succeed.</span></p>
<h3><b>Choose fitness studio </b><b>premises</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you open a fitness studio from scratch, it is important to choose the right location. If you have a small hall planned (up to 150 square meters) and you are counting on a small audience, it is better to open a club in a calm neighborhood so that people can visit it in their free time. It can consist of one training room, a locker room, and a bathroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is reasonable to open a large fitness club with an extensive list of services for different groups of visitors in the city center or in the large shopping centers so that it is convenient to get to it from different parts of the district.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most fitness centers are designed for up to 60 people in an area of ​​about 400 square meters. They accommodate:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">reception desk;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">locker rooms;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bathroom;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">training room and a room for group classes.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Real calculation of income and expenses</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you open a fitness studio, multiply the cost of all possible costs by two, and reduce the probable income by 2 times for six months in advance. Why do this? Because absolutely all risks and problems cannot be predicted. By calculating the increased costs and reduced income, you can improve the model of your new business in the first stages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To avoid potential risks, many people decide to work on a franchise. Usually, it is less costly and, as a huge plus, you have a well-established brand. Anyway, this approach has its pros and cons.</span></p>
<h3><b>What do you need to know to open a franchise fitness studio?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, when you think about how to open a fitness club: from scratch or under a franchise, you choose between taking risks and a viable, well-considered business model. In these cases, guarantees for profitability are different.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With your own business from scratch, fitness clubs do not receive a large flow of visitors in the first six months. About 85% of them quickly close due to a lack of experience and incorrect calculations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In cooperation with the franchisor, you are only looking for a room and draw up permits. Other issues are dealt with by the franchise developer. Then the probability of a successful startup is much more. But if you want to calculate as accurately as possible how much it costs to open a fitness room for a franchise, you should consider not only the initial payment but also monthly percentage-based payroll. These deductions are made as a percentage of income or a fixed rate. Some franchisors require up to 70%.</span></p>
<h3><b>Differentiate from your competitors</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to minimizing business risks, you need to develop a strategy that makes you different from your competitors. Make it easy for your customers to reach you anywhere they are and book your services. </span><a href="https://partners.yclients.com/en" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YCLIENTS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allow you to automate your business and minimize costs by:</span></p>
