We are all in this together and still fighting for each other. But it doesn\u2019t mean the virus impact on business is only negative! Yes, we can\u2019t deny the financial problems everyone is facing now, but the crisis always makes you think of new ways to earn more or the ways to optimize your business when it is all over.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Things are definitely going to change. Soon your clients start coming back (yes they will!), it could be hard to manage your business with only pen and paper \u2014 it will only make it harder to grow your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, when everyone else is taking compelled break \u2014 be smarter and take your time to think of how you can increase your revenue after the crisis. You have the power to change, evolve and adapt to the current innovative times. See these times as an opportunity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The traditional method of taking appointments typically looks like that: the client calling to book a service, waiting till someone there picks up the phone and only then your staff schedule this appointment. Quite time-consuming and sometimes really inconvenient, hah? How to step further and get those tech-savvy potential clients and also optimize all your routine to be more efficient and have more time for more important tasks after the quarantine when it is needed the most?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Need a solution? Pick any from the list!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>1. Let people book you online<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As it was said before, time is changing \u2013 digital spreads wider to all types of businesses and the current crisis proved it. Buying and ordering services via a smartphone is a common thing. The possibility of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yclients.com\/en\">online booking<\/a> is a great opportunity to demonstrate to your clients that you keep up with the time and to allow them to book your services wherever they are.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get new appointments 24\/7 on your website, in messengers, socials or your branded app.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4066 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.yclients.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Dizajn-bez-nazvaniya-3.png\" alt=\"online booking app\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.yclients.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Dizajn-bez-nazvaniya-3.png 560w, https:\/\/www.yclients.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Dizajn-bez-nazvaniya-3-300x169.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schedule Calendar makes things even easier to control at ease: schedule, update and assign appointments to your employees in a few clicks. Your staff members will always have access to their schedules.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4064 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.yclients.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Dizajn-bez-nazvaniya-2.png\" alt=\"appointment schedule calendar\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.yclients.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Dizajn-bez-nazvaniya-2.png 560w, https:\/\/www.yclients.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Dizajn-bez-nazvaniya-2-300x169.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These measures lead to higher staff productivity \u2013 you and your team can spend less time on cumbersome tasks, and get higher-level jobs done much more efficiently excluding human errors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>2. Convert your customers into the loyal ones<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the lockdown times, only the strongest businesses will remain working and there will be even higher competition for the clients who, unfortunately, lost their previous place to get the services they need. Don\u2019t cut your marketing costs as it is what helps your business running.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is time to be especially customer-oriented and find a solution that can easily store your customer preferences and personal notes, so you can track their service history and stay updated with their habits, likes, and dislikes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the collected information &#8212; group your clients and create a special communication strategy with them via email or SMS. Send them special offers or wish a happy birthday. Be nice!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>3. Reduce the number of no-shows or late arrivals and save your money<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our research at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yclients.com\/en\">YCLIENTS<\/a> found that sending an appointment reminder reduced late arrivals by 60%. For this reason, it\u2019s essential that you confirm, remind, and follow-up with customers who have booked a service.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4065 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.yclients.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/push.png\" alt=\"appointment reminder\" width=\"734\" height=\"264\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.yclients.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/push.png 734w, https:\/\/www.yclients.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/push-300x108.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 734px) 100vw, 734px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t forget about the email communication! Let your clients know you are still there for them &#8212; send newsletters or just update them on how things are going.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When your business is open for visitors again, feel free to use this template to let your clients know they are welcome again:<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><strong>Subject line:<\/strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yay!
